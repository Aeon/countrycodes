Motivation:
===========

Publishing an updated version of the iso country code list usable for web projects.
Thanks to Bill Rhodes for his original distribution at http://27.org/isocountrylist/, it has come in handy, but is not up to date any more.

Sources:
========

http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists.htm for two-letter character codes
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm for three-letter character codes and numeric identifiers.

Usage:
======
The csv is tab-separated, utf-8 encoded.

The mysql dump has some weird-looking characters, but they show up correctly once you do the import. If you correct them to how they should look like, mysql will get confused on import and mess them up, so don't do it.
